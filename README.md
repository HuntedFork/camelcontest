# What is this?

This is a fully implemented version of camel up intended to be used to facilitate bot competitions. If you're interested in creating a camelup bot please make a pull request and add your brain to the brains folder.

## Do I need to make an advanced bot?
No. Just make something that can beat rollerbrain and you'll be fine.

## How do I implement a bot?
1. Copy rollbrain.py in the brains folder
2. Change the classname of your class
3. Optional: change the default name of your bot
4. implement take_turn. Your bot receives a GameState object (in the api file) and must return a Turn subclass (also in the api file).
5. Optional: to see your bot play against other bots, add it to the players array in main.py and run it.
6. make a pull request. You're done!

## Can I make changes to the rest of the code?
Yes please squash my bugs


## Will you implement Crazy Camels
I hate crazy camels
